<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
An introduction to CAMOS
</p>
<p>
CAMOS (Computer Aided Medical Ordering System) is, on the surface, 
just a fancy interface for organizing and choosing pieces of text 
to insert into a patient's chart.  It is designed to be intuitive
and easy to use.
</p>

<h1>Basic Use</h1>
<p><a href='#top'>Top</a></p>
<p>
<b>add</b> button - Type something in the text box above the button and it will be added to the column above.

</p>
<p>
<b>clone last visit</b> button - Returns all CAMOS submitted items from last encounter plus billing table data.  Data is displayed in the content box in camos function format (see advanced section below).  By last encounter, we mean the last encounter which has billing entries associated with it.

Comments.  CAMOS supports C style comments.  Here is how they work.  A comment opens with /* and closes with */.  You cannot nest comments.  You cannot overlap comments.  Anything in a comment will be seen within CAMOS in the item window, but it will not show when you enter it into the patient's chart.  This is useful for making notes on items that are not appropriate to go in the chart.  You may want, for example, to document which insurance a particular facility accepts. 

</p>

<div class='box'>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
/* Accepts BC/BS */   ok
/* rx list follows */ ok
/* /*     */ */       not right
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<b>Embedded functions</b><br>  
</p>
<p>
Embedded functions are contained within comments.  The first word is the function name.  A '::' follows, and then a list of function arguments, each seperated by '::'.
</p>
<p>
The <b>billing</b> function<br><br>
If you want to enter an entry into the billing table to have, for example, a CPT4 or ICD9 code come up after entering a CAMOS form into a patient's chart, do this:
</p>
<b>billing function signature</b>
<div class='box'>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
/*billing::code_type::code::code_text::modifier::units::fee::justify1::justify2*/
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<b>Examples</b>
<div class='box'>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
/*billing::CPT4::80054::CMP:: :: ::50.00*/ /*add a cmp for $50*/ 
/*billing::CPT4::85024::CBC:: :: ::25.00*/ /*add a cbc*/ 
/*billing::CPT4::80061::Lipid Panel:: :: ::50.00*/ 
/*billing::ICD9::V70.0::physical:: :: ::0.00*/ /*this is a diagnosis, not a procedure*/ 
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The <b>camos</b> function, CAMOS calling CAMOS:
</p>
<p>
This function is used by the cloning features.  You may take advantage of it yourself. Obvserve how it is used.  Keyword is 'camos' and arguments are category, subcatory, item, content.
</p>
<p>
The <b>replace</b> function.  Used as follows:
</p>
<div class='box'>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
Atenolol 50mg
/*replace::30 tablets qd*/
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
In this example, the replace function looks for an 'item' entry called '30 tablets qd' and replaces the function call with the text from the associated content box.  This replace function works recursively, meaning that if the text which is used in the replacement contains a call to 'replace' itself, this will be called as well.  Other function calls will be executed only after all replace calls are completed.
