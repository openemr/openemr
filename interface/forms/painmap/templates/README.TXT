The painmap form will use the image named 'painmap.png'.
It is currently a copy of 'body-map-male-n-female.png

Other supplied forms are:
- body-map-female.png
- podiatry-feet.png

Copy any PNG image you prefer in it's place prior to
entering actual form data as the XY coordinates will
not align correctly after the fact.

The image should be no more than 600 pixels wide to 
fit nicely on the enounter page.
