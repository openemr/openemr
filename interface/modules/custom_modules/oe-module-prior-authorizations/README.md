# Authorizations Module of OpenEMR
This module is to help a practice manage the authorizations needed to be paid for a patients visit.
Most practices that need to get authorization need a way to manage those authorizations. This module provides
the tools necessary to see what authorizations the patient have in the system. The module allows this
authorization to be tracked through the life cycle so when expired a new authorization can be obtained.

## Getting Started
If you are installing this module into an already existing practice. The module will grab the authorizations that
have been stored in the system. These authorizations are stored when the Miscellaneous Billing Option form are used.
The module pulls those out and displays them to present a history of the authorizations for that patient. The
system will allow the management of units.
