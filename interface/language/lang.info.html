Multi Language Tool.

This module has very few components to care about.

The first one is the following settings you can find at globals.php. These
settings allow you to toggle on/off the login language menu, control what
is in this menu, and set the default language.

// Language Control Section
//
//  Current supported languages:
//   English
//   Swedish
//   Spanish
//   German
//   Dutch
//   Hebrew
//   French
//   Norwegian
//
//  'language_menu_login' toggle
//    -If set to true then will allow language selection on login
//    -If set to false then will not show menu in login and will use default
(see below)
$GLOBALS['language_menu_login'] = true;
//
//  'language_menu_all' toggle
//    -If set to true then show all languages in login menu
//    -If set to false then only show chosen (see below) languages in login
menu
$GLOBALS['language_menu_showall'] = true;
//
//  'language_menu_show' array
//    -ONLY pertinent if above 'language_menu_all' toggle is set to false
//    -Displays these chosen languages in the login menu
$GLOBALS['language_menu_show'] = array('English','Swedish');
//
//  'language_default'
//    -Sets the default language
//    -If login menu is on, then it will highlight this choice in menu
//    -If login menu is off, then it will choose this language
$GLOBALS['language_default'] = "English";

The second thing is the module itself.
The translations are an ongoing project.  If you would like to add a
language, help with a current language, or add a custom constant, please contact us.  We use a
collaborative Google Docs spreadsheet to allow you to enter your
translations which we then convert to the mysql tables.  This process has
become very streamlined with a fast turnaround time, so we would suggest
you enter data on this collaborative spreadsheet rather than entering into your local OpenEMR
installation only.

The options in the admin->language menu are.
Add Language: You get a box to enter a new language.

Add Constant: You get a box to add a new string to be used in the translation function, this one should be used only if you know what you are doing, mostly, if you added some custom programming with new text output. The "constant" string can be literally what you want to say or a shorter reference to it.

Edit Definitions: English is used as the reference language, if you click the English label you'll get a set of all constants and the English definitions at the side. If no definition is loaded yet for a given constant then a blank box is shown, by entering a definition and clicking "Load Definition" you save whatever changes you made.

If you click other label than English, you get a set of all constants, the English definition at the side, and an input box to enter/modify the definition in the selected language.

For Developers:
The translation is done by the xl() custom function.
Its semantics are very simple.

xl (string[,'r'[,string prepend[,string append]])

Which with examples means:

xl ('translate this')

By default the function will return (after all, is a function) the translation.

First it uses the LANGUAGE constant defined to pick the translation.

Second it goes for the translation, if none is found, then the same string entered is used and returned as is.

The first optional and only argument is 'e' which stands for echo. Use it if you want the function to echo the translated result instead of returning it.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','e')

But if you are already within another function, then you want the function to return something.

i.e.
echo ("this and".xl ('translate this')."that too");

The third and fourth optional arguments are strings to be prepend and appended respectively.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','e','&#60b>',&#60/b>);

will echo
&#60b>this translated&#60/b>

If you want only something to be appended in the a return, then you must supply empty second and third arguments.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','','',&#60br>);
will echo
this translated&#60br>
