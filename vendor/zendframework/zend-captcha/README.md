`Zend\Captcha` component is able to manage “Completely Automated Public Turing
test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” (CAPTCHA); it is used as a
challenge-response to ensure that the individual submitting information is a
human and not an automated process. Typically, a captcha is used with form
submissions where authenticated users are not necessary, but you want to prevent
spam submissions.
