/**
 * LogoFilterEvent is intended to be used to filter the web url path for where a logo can be found.  It is dispatched
 * in the LogoService class and allows for the web path to be modified by other modules or services.
 *
 * This is most likely to be used by a theme module to change the logo path for a specific type of logo, such as core/menu/primary/logo.png.
 * If multiple modules are registered to this event, the last one to set the web path will be the one that is used.
