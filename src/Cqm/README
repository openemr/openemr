To generate new models, update the path to qdm-modelinfo-*.xml and the oids_qdm_*.json files
The oids_qdm file was pulled from projecttacoma:
https://github.com/projecttacoma/cqm-models/tree/master/data

Run the "Generate Models" command in the CQM Tools module.

If you are running a remote deployment, you'll have to copy the models from your remote server to the git repo.
However, do not overwrite the BaseTypes and Traits directories, as they are not auto-generated.
