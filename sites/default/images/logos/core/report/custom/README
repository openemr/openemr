# Primary Menu Logo

This README ensures the directory path exists for the custom report logo.

To add a logo to the custom report page, place an image file
in this folder named "logo". File type can be PNG, JPG, SVG, or any other
file type that can be rendered using the `<img>` tag's `src` property.

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.
