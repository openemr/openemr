# Favicon

This README ensures the directory path exists for branding the favicon.

To change the standard "OpenEMR" favicon, place an image file
in this folder named "favicon.ico".

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.

This allows every multisite install to showcase a custom favicon.

## Note
Favicons have become more robost throughout the years, and various images can
now be used based on the browser (i.e. macOS Safari can render an SVG with
various options. At this time, OpenEMR can only customize a .ico file). Future
work will expand to create the various favicons that can be consumed.
