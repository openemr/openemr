<h4>HIPAA Declaration</h4>Given today: {DOS}
OpenEMR Software makes it a priority to keep this piece of software updated with the most recent available security options,  so it will integrate easily into a HIPAA-compliant practice and will protect our customers with at least the official HIPAA regulations.
<em>The Practice:</em> 
(a) Is required by federal law to  maintain the privacy of your PHI and to provide you with this Privacy Notice detailing the Practice's legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your PHI

<em>Patient Communications:</em>
Health Insurance Privacy Act 1996 USA, requires to inform you of the following government stipulations in order for  us to contact you with educational and promotional items in the future via e-mail, U.S. mail, telephone, and/or prerecorded messages. We will not share, sell, or use your  personal contact information for spam messages. 
I am aware and have read the policies of this practice towards secrecy and digital information protection:
The Practice set up their User accounts for the OpenEMR databases, so it requires Users to log in with a password. 
The User have to exit or log out of any medical information when not using it or as soon as Default timeout is reached. 
When using this medical information registration in front of patients the User should use the "Privacy" feature to hide PHI (Personal Health Information) for other patients in the Search screen. 
We have developed and will use standard operating procedures (SOPs) requiring any use of the Export Patients Medical or other information to be documented. 
Users are only allowed to store a copy of  your Medical information on a laptop computer or other portable media that is taken outside The Practice if recorded in writing. By signing out of The Practice with any portable device or transport medium this information is to be erased when finished with the need to take this information out of The Practice, if possible this information is only to be taken outside The Practice in encrypted format. 
Only specific technicians may have occasional access to our hardware and Software. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that a practice have a signed Business Associate Contract before granting such access. The Technicians are trained on HIPAA regulations and limit the use and disclosure of customer data to the minimum necessary.
