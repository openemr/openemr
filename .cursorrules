# Cursor Rules for OpenEMR

> **ðŸ“– For general OpenEMR project information, see [AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**
>
> This file contains Cursor-specific configuration and behaviors.

## Cursor-Specific Behaviors

### IDE Integration
- Leverage Cursor's file navigation and symbol search capabilities
- Use Cursor's inline suggestions for code completion within existing patterns
- Prefer Cursor's multi-file editing capabilities for related changes

### Code Generation
- When generating code with Cursor, mark sections with:
```php
/*
 * BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE - Cursor
 * The following code section was generated by Cursor AI
 */
// AI-generated code here
/*
 * END AI-GENERATED CODE - Cursor
 */
```

- For single lines:
```php
$result = processData($input); // AI-generated line - Cursor
```

### File Creation Guidelines
- Use Cursor's file templates when available for new OpenEMR components
- Follow existing file patterns in the target directory
- Prefer extending existing files over creating new ones

### Development Workflow
- Use Cursor's built-in terminal for running development commands
- Leverage Cursor's integrated git features for version control
- Use Cursor's search and replace across multiple files for refactoring
