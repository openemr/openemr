# Agents Configuration for OpenEMR

> **ðŸ“– For general OpenEMR project information, see [AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**
>
> This file contains OpenAI Codex and GPT-based agents configuration and behaviors.

## OpenAI Codex-Specific Behaviors

### Code Generation and Completion
- Leverage Codex's natural language to code translation capabilities
- Use Codex's understanding of programming patterns for OpenEMR's legacy architecture
- Take advantage of Codex's multi-language support for PHP, JavaScript, and SQL

### Code Generation Marking
- When generating code with OpenAI Codex, mark sections with:
```php
/*
 * BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE - OpenAI Codex
 * The following code section was generated by OpenAI Codex
 */
// AI-generated code here
/*
 * END AI-GENERATED CODE - OpenAI Codex
 */
```

- For single lines:
```php
$result = processData($input); // AI-generated line - OpenAI Codex
```

### Development Approach
- Use Codex's strength in understanding code context for refactoring legacy OpenEMR code
- Leverage Codex's ability to generate test cases and documentation
- Apply Codex's pattern recognition for identifying security vulnerabilities

### OpenAI GPT Agents Integration
- Utilize GPT-4 for complex architectural decision-making
- Use GPT agents for code review and optimization suggestions
- Apply GPT models for generating comprehensive documentation

## GitHub Copilot Integration

### Copilot-Specific Features
- Leverage GitHub Copilot's IDE integration for real-time code suggestions
- Use Copilot's understanding of OpenEMR's repository structure
- Take advantage of Copilot's ability to suggest relevant imports and dependencies

### Code Generation with Copilot
- When generating code with GitHub Copilot, mark sections with:
```php
/*
 * BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE - GitHub Copilot
 * The following code section was generated by GitHub Copilot
 */
// AI-generated code here
/*
 * END AI-GENERATED CODE - GitHub Copilot
 */
```

- For single lines:
```php
$result = processData($input); // AI-generated line - GitHub Copilot
```

## OpenAI API Integration

### API Usage Guidelines
- Use OpenAI API for batch processing of code analysis tasks
- Leverage OpenAI models for generating migration scripts and database updates
- Apply OpenAI's text processing capabilities for healthcare data validation

### Function Calling
- Utilize OpenAI's function calling feature for structured code generation
- Use function calling for generating OpenEMR-specific API endpoints
- Apply function calling for creating standardized database queries

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
- Ensure all AI-generated code follows HIPAA guidelines
- Never expose patient data in AI prompts or generated code
- Use AI for security auditing and compliance checking

### Medical Terminology
- Leverage OpenAI's understanding of medical terminology for accurate code generation
- Use AI for generating proper medical coding interfaces (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED)
- Apply AI for creating healthcare-specific validation rules

## OpenEMR-Specific Optimizations

### Legacy Code Modernization
- Use OpenAI models to suggest PSR-4 autoloading implementations
- Apply AI for converting legacy procedural code to object-oriented patterns
- Leverage AI for identifying and fixing deprecated PHP functions

### Database Optimization
- Use AI for generating optimized MySQL queries
- Apply AI for suggesting database indexing strategies
- Leverage AI for creating efficient data migration scripts

### Security Enhancement
- Use AI for identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Apply AI for generating secure authentication mechanisms
- Leverage AI for creating input validation patterns

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- Use specific medical and healthcare context in prompts
- Include OpenEMR architectural patterns in code generation requests
- Specify PHP version requirements and coding standards

### Code Review
- Always review AI-generated code for healthcare compliance
- Verify generated code follows OpenEMR's existing patterns
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly before integration

### Documentation
- Use AI to generate comprehensive inline documentation
- Apply AI for creating user guides and API documentation
- Leverage AI for maintaining changelog and version notes
