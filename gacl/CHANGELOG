                For example, you may want to differentiate between automatically created ACLs (System ACLs) and
                manually created ACLs (User ACLs). As some installations may have several thousand automatically created
                ACLs, its nice to filter these out.

Sat Mar 01 2003
        - Fixed up the layers with AXO show/hide functionality. Usable, but still needs improvement.

Thu Feb 20 2003

Tue Feb 18 2003
        - Added 'force_cache_expire' option, so the cache is automaticalled expired when ACL/Group modifications take place.
                This should allow the cache_expire_time to be greatly increased (86400?) and still maintain instance updates.

        - Fixed bug caused by overzealous array_unique in add_acl()
        - Switched acl_query() to return TRUE/FALSE for the 'allow' return value instead of 1/0
        - API group functions didn't manipulate the path_to_root mapping when reparenting or deleting occured.

Tue Feb 04 2003
        - Fixed bug in edit_group(), added more error checking.
        - Added object searching to the assign group pages.
        - Moved all templates to $smarty_template_dir/phpgacl/ to better integrate with existing smarty installations.
        - Fixed recursion in format_groups() so it doesn't use globals anymore.
        - Greatly improved performance in sort_groups() (50% improvement) and format_groups() (20%) functions.

        - Added conflict detection to add_acl();

Thu Jan 30 2003
        - Created search_acl() to search for ACLs mapped to specific objects. This should also work for detecting conflicting ACLs.
        - Created shift_acl() that basically does the opposite of append_acl(). Remove just the specific objects from the ACL mapping.

Wed Jan 29 2003
        - Created append_acl() function for simply appending ACO/ARO/ARO Groups/AXO/AXO Groups on to an already existing ACL.

Mon Jan 28 2003
        - Added ACL searching.
        - Added ACL debug page.
        - Added sanity checks to add_acl()/edit_acl() to make sure the objects mapped to ACLs actually exist.
        - Transactionalized most API functions.

Fri Jan 24 2003
        - Fixed JS UnSelect button bug for AXO groups.
        - Added Object searching to help the admin interface handle an unlimited number of objects.
        - Added "max_select_box_items" config option to set the maximum number of items shown in select boxes.

Tue Jan 14 2003
        - Upgraded ADODB to v3.00
        - Added user definable ACL return values, along with the acl_return_value() function.
        - Added ACL notes which serve no other purpose other than to help the administrator keep track of ACL's
        - Added paging for large record sets.

Sun Dec 15 2002
        - Moved to a completely OO structure.
        - Config options can now be passed during object creation. $gacl = new gacl($options);

Sun Dec 01 2002
        - Fixed bug that broke allow and enabled from being changed when editing ACLs.

Sat Nov 30 2002
        - Merged ERASE feature in to API functions, del_object() and del_object_section() thanks to Martino.
        - Changed the acl list page layout
        - Changed the acl test page layout
        - Added assigned object count to the group admin page.
        - Fixed a JS bug that wouldn't allow you to "select" (>>) any objects at all, if one was already selected.

Sun Nov 17 2002
        - format_groups() function wasn't recursing as efficiently as it could be. Fixed.
        - Re-wrote API aro/aco/group specific functions to be generic to help support AXO's.
        - Re-wrote aro/aco/group specific admin scripts to be generic to help support AXO's.
        - Added AXO support to acl_admin.php.
        - Updated gacl.inc.php to support AXO's.

Mon Nov 11 2002
        - Changed the ordering of the main acl_query() SQL query. It wasn't properly preferring the deepest groups ACLs. - Thanks to Mauro
                for spotting this one and helping me track it down.
        - Fixed bug that prevented ACO/ARO's with the same 'value' in different sections from being assigned to an ACL. - Thanks to Martino
        - Fixed bug that made it seem like assigning a single ARO to a group really added all AROs with the same value to that group. - Thanks to Martino
        - Fixed bug causing virtual subtree'ing to only traverse 2 levels of the tree. - Thanks to Martino
        - Used __DIR__ to remove the need for users to manually set the root path in config.inc.php.

Wed Oct 23 2002
        - Switched away from ID's in favor of VALUES for most functions, including acl_check(). Broke all backwards compatibility.
        - Modified DB Schema to reflect above.
        - When ARO/ACO values are changed, the API will modify said values in all tables.
        - Added a variable for phpGACL's current path.

Wed Oct 09 2002
        - Added "hidden" flags to relavent API functions
        - Added Oracle 8i schema to setup.php
        - Changed group "level" table column name to "tree_level", as the old name "level" was a reserved word in some db's.
                MySQL: ALTER TABLE `groups_path` CHANGE `level` `tree_level` INT(12) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL
        - Modified a few of the queries to be more portable, specifically for Oracle's sake.
        - Added a FAQ entry regarding individualized item permissions.

Wed Sep 25 2002
        - Added multi-layer ACO checking to ACL_QUERY()
        - Removed multi-layer ACO checking in favor of "dual" acl checking. ie:
                If you want to set ACL's on a contact list. Create ACO's for each Contact in the list.
                and create more generic ACO's for things like "View - Contacts", "Edit - Contacts".
                Then simply create an ACL with ACO's "View - Contacts" AND "Contact ID: 15"
                Then if ( acl_check("View - Contacts", "John Doe") AND acl_check("Contact ID: 15", "John Doe"))
                Very simple, and should be just as fast, or faster then adding more bloat to the database.
        - Added "hidden" flag to ACO, ACO Sections, ARO, and ARO sections.
