<h2>Accounting & Receivables</h2>
<p>Users classified as Accounting or Administrator are also authorized to enter receivables for the clinic.  Checks received from insurance companies can be entered here and distributed to cover the appropriate encounters.  Patients can also be billed, and their payments recorded.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Benefits</h3>
<p>To begin, select 'Fees -  Billing' from the navigation menu and click 'EOBs' to bring up the  Explanation of Benefits  Search window.  This is  where you can upload an ERA file (click 'Help' in the upper  right-hand corner for more information) or begin inputting payments  manually.</p>
<img src="processed/114.png" />
<p>At the top you may enter a  source ( Eg. check number ), pay date and check amount. The  amount field will be automatically decremented as payments are  entered into the associated invoices.  When all invoices  have been completed this value should be zero.</p>
<img src="processed/115.png" />
<p>The search fields, with  the blue background, are for locating a specific invoice (or  invoices).  Enter the appropriate parameters, such as the date of  service, and click 'Search' to bring up a list of all invoices  (claims) matching the requested parameters.</p>
<img src="processed/116.png" />
<p>The list shows the patient  and invoice number, as well as the current balance to be paid.  The  number with a '-' in the 'Prv' column indicates the number of  insurance companies for which this invoice is awaiting payment.</p>
<h3>Entering Payments</h3>
<p>Clicking the invoice  number you wish to work with opens the EOB Invoice window.  Notice  that the source and pay date from the previous window have been  copied over; this saves time in the common case where a single check  from the insurance company pays for multiple claims. </p>
<img src="processed/117.png" />
<p>The EOB Invoice page  contains a detailed list of payments made on this invoice so far.   Enter the payment amount next to the remaining balance, and check  'Needs secondary billing'.  This will allow the claim to be  re-billed to the secondary insurance. Select 'Done with Ins1' above  to indicate that the primary insurance EOB has been posted.  When you  are finished, click 'Save'.</p>
<img src="processed/118.png" />
<p>Once payment has been  billed and received from secondary insurance, it can be entered in  the same way.  Enter the source and pay date, etc. and locate the  appropriate invoice(s) using the search function. </p>
<p>Payment amounts are now  shown along with the remaining balance.  The number in the 'Prv'  column has also decreased.  Select the invoice number to bring up the  EOB Invoice window again.</p>
<img src="processed/119.png" />
<p>Enter the payment amount  and select 'Ins2' to indicate that the secondary insurance EOB has  been posted.</p>
<p>Invoice adjustments may  also be made here.  Enter the adjustment amount (or click 'W' to  waive the entire remaining balance), and select a reason for the  adjustment from the drop-down list provided.  Click 'Save' when  finished.</p>
<h3>Patient Invoices and  Payments</h3>
<p>Once payments from the  insurance companies have been received and entered, you can use  OpenEMR's EOB page to generate invoices for billing patients the  remaining amounts.</p>
<img src="processed/120.png" />
<p>Select 'Due Pt' from the  drop-down list and click 'Search' to display a list of all invoices  that are awaiting payment from patients.  Invoices still awaiting  payments from insurance companies will not be shown.</p>
<img src="processed/121.png" />
<p>Check the box next to the  desired invoice and click 'Print Selected Statements' to generate an  invoice for that patient using a customizable template.  Depending on  your clinic's OpenEMR configuration, the invoice may be printed  automatically.</p>
<img src="processed/122.png" />
<p>A '1' in the  'Prv' column  now indicates that the patient has been billed once for this claim.   This number will increment every time a new invoice is printed for  this encounter.  This is useful when printing so that second  and later notices may be worded differently from the initial  statement. </p>
<p>You can also click on the  patient's name in the invoice list to create a billing note for that  patient.  Enter your note into the text field and click 'Save'.</p>
<img src="processed/123.png" />
<p>Once payment has been  received, it can be entered into the invoice in the same manner as  the insurance payments.  In the 'Now posting for' list be sure to  select 'Patient'.  Enter the payment amount as before and click  'Save'. </p>
