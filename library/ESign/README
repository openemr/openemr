In order to properly build an ESign implementation, developer must implement
the FactoryIF interface. This ensures that you create all of the necessary 
parts of an ESign implementation.

Developer must subclass Abstract_Controller for the routing to work properly.  

Developer should implement the IFactory interface so the ESign API can assemble
the ESign object using \ESign\Api::createEsign(FactoryIF)

Refer to the Form and Encounter implementations for examples on how to implement
the required interfaces.
