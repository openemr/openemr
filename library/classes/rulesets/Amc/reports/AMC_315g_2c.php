/**
 *
 * AMC_315g_2c handles the population calculation for ยง170.315 (g)(2) Required Test 2c which has
 * the following requirement from MIPS for Required Test 2:
 *
 * For at least one unique patient seen by the MIPS eligible clinician: (1) The
 * patient (or the patient-authorized representative) is provided timely access to
 * view online, download, and transmit his or her health information; and (2) The
 * MIPS eligible clinician ensures the patient's health information is available for
 * the patient (or patient-authorized representative) to access using any
 * application of their choice that is configured to meet the technical specifications
 * of the Application Programming Interface (API) in the MIPS eligible clinician's
 * certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT).
 *
 * We currently only support the ONC Required Test 2c version of this requirement as we do not support
 * the View, Download, Transmit (VDT) of ยง170.315 (e)(1) from the patient portal.  Only clinicians can VDT on behalf
 * of a patient.
