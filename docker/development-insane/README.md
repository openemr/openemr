### Insane Development Docker Environment ###
The Insane Development Docker Environment will load up about 37 separate dockers and allow you to
test almost any version of mysql/mariadb/php, however it is not nearly as easy to use as the above Easy Development
Docker Environment. See below for instructions of use of the Insane Development Docker Environment.

#### Setup

**Step 1.** Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
[docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and
[compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your system. Also, make
sure you have a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of OpenEMR.
- If you want to set up the base services(e.g. git, docker, docker-compose, openemr-cmd) easily, please try [openemr-env-installer](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/utilities/openemr-env-installer)
- If you want to troubleshoot with the below steps easier, please also [install openemr-cmd](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/utilities/openemr-cmd) for your system
- If you want to monitor and easily manage the docker environment, please also [install openemr-monitor](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/utilities/openemr-monitor) and [install portainer](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/utilities/portainer) for your system
- If you want to migrator the running docker environment, please try [openemr-env-migrator](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/utilities/openemr-env-migrator)

**Step 2.** Start OpenEMR.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/openemr.git
```
There are 2 different schools of thought on where to run the docker from.
- Option 1. Run the docker from within your git repository.(this is also where you edit
scripts in your editor)
```bash
$ cd openemr/docker/development-insane
$ docker-compose up -d
```
- Option 2. Run the docker from a separate directory that is synchronized with your git
repository. For example, if used /var/www/openemr.
```bash
 $ cd /var/www/openemr/docker/development-insane
 $ docker-compose up -d
```
- At this time, I highly recommend option 2 since running OpenEMR will change
scripts, add files, add cache files, thus making it very tough to track your
code change. Modern GUI Editors support this; for example PHPStorm can be
set up to do this every time you save a script via
[PHP Storm Customizing Upload](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/customizing-upload.html).
 - Option 2 also allows support to quickly change branches on a repository to
develop/test other code. This is done by first running a command or script
to delete and replace the synchronized directory (ie. remove the /var/www/openemr
directory) and then restart the development docker (see below for how to do this)

**Step 3.** Open up OpenEMR in the latest Chrome or Firefox! You have many
options to choose from:

- https://localhost:9156 with SSL (with Nginx and PHP-FPM 8.4 with redis)
- https://localhost:9157 with SSL (with Nginx and PHP-FPM 8.5 with redis)

**Step 4.** Setup up OpenEMR. The first time you run OpenEMR (and whenever you clear and replace your
synchronized openemr directory and restart the development docker). On the main
setup input screen:
 - for `Server Host`, use either `mariadb` or `mariadb-ssl` or `mysql` or `mariadb-old` or `mariadb-very-old` or
   `mariadb-very-very-old` or `mysql-old` (you have all
   mariadb/mysql/mariadb-\*/mysql-\* dockers ready to go to make testing either one easy;
   `mysql` is version 8.4; `mysql-old` is version 8.0; `mysql-old-old` is version 5.7;
   `mariadb` is version 11.4; `mariadb-ssl` is version 11.4 with support for ssl; `mariadb-old` is version 10.11; `mariadb-very-old` is
   version 10.6; `mariadb-very-very-old` is version 10.5)
 - for `Root Pass`, use `root`
 - for `User Hostname`, use `%`

#### Stop/Clean Out Dockers
There are frequently times where you will want to remove the dockers and start anew.
For example, when you change github branches and start testing/developing on a
different github branch. This is done by first running a command or script
to delete and replace the synchronized directory (ie. remove the /var/www/openemr
directory) and then restart the development docker:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Updating Dockers
To ensure you are using the most recent dockers, recommend running below set of commands intermittently:
```console
docker pull openemr/openemr:flex-edge
docker pull openemr/openemr:flex-3.20
docker pull openemr/openemr:flex-3.18
docker pull openemr/openemr:flex-3.17
docker pull openemr/openemr:flex-3.15-8
docker pull openemr/dev-php-fpm:8.5
docker pull openemr/dev-php-fpm:8.4

```

#### Usage

##### Examine Containers

Run `$ docker ps` to see the OpenEMR and MySQL containers in the following format:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NAMES

```
 - Note the `NAMES` column is extremely important and how you run docker commands
on specific containers. For example, to go into a shell script in the
`development-insane_openemr-8-3_1` container, would use:
```bash
docker exec -it development-insane_openemr-8-3_1 bash
```

##### Bash Access

```
$ docker exec -it <container_NAME> bash
```

##### MySQL Client Access
There are 2 options for gui access:
 - GUI can be accessed via the phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8200 for all sql dockers
 - Or you can directly connect to port 8210 (`mariadb` server only) or 8220 (`mysql` server only) via your favorite sql tool (Mysql Workbench etc.). Note this option is limited to the `mysql` and `mariadb` servers.
If you are interested in using the MySQL client line as opposed to a GUI program, execute the following (password is passed in/is simple because this is for local development purposes):

```
$ docker exec -it <container_NAME> mysql -u root --password=root openemr
```

##### Apache Error Log Tail

```
$ docker exec -it <container_NAME> tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```
...if you want the `access.log`, you can use this approach as well.

##### Recommended Development Setup

While there is no officially recommended toolset for programming OpenEMR,
many in the community have found
[PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/),
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/),
and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) to be useful for coding. For database work,
[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or PhpMyAdmin
offers a smooth experience.

Many helpful tips and development "rules of thumb" can be found by reviewing
[OpenEMR Development](http://open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Wiki_Home_Page#Development).
Remember that learning to code against a very large and complex system is not a
task that will be completed over night. Feel free to post on
[the development forums](https://community.open-emr.org/c/openemr-development)
if you have any questions after reviewing the wiki.

##### Ports

See the `docker-compose.yml` file in the contrib/util/docker directory for port details.

All host machine ports can be changed by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
Host ports differ from the internal container ports by default to avoid conflicts
services potentially running on the host machine (a web server such as Nginx,
Tomcat, or Apache2 could be installed on the host machine that makes use of
port 80, for instance).

##### Additional Build Tools

Programmers looking to use OpenEMR's and [Composer and NPM](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php//Composer_and_NPM)
build tools can simply `bash` into the OpenEMR container and use them as expected.

##### CouchDB
In OpenEMR, CouchDB is an option for the patients document storage. For this reason, a CouchDB
docker is included in this OpenEMR docker development environment. You can visit the CouchDB
GUI directly via http://localhost:5984/_utils/ or https://localhost:6984/_utils/ with
username `admin` and password `password`. You can configure OpenEMR to use this CouchDB
docker for patient document storage in OpenEMR at Administration->Globals->Documents:
- Document Storage Method->CouchDB
- CouchDB HostName->couchdb
- CouchDB UserName->admin
- CouchDB Password->password
- CouchDB Port->6984
- CouchDB Database can be set to any name you want

##### OpenLDAP
In OpenEMR, LDAP is an option for user authentication. You can configure OpenEMR to use the
OpenLDAP docker patient authentication in OpenEMR at Administration->Globals->Security:
- LDAP - Server Name or URI : ldap://openldap:389
- LDAP - Distinguished Name of User : cn={login},dc=example,dc=org
- LDAP - Login Exclusions : (place whatever your admin login is; warning, do not use "admin" for your openemr admin login)

(note that using 'cn' rather than 'uid' in this case for the distinguished name since the default openldap docker hasn't assigned a uid to the "admin" user)

Then create a user named “admin” in OpenEMR. When you log in as that user, the password is “admin”.

#### Ongoing Development

##### Orthanc
Developers are currently working on integrating the Orthanc PACS server into OpenEMR. This
feature is currently under development. Although it is not yet integrated with OpenEMR yet,
you can connect to the Orthanc application gui via http://localhost:8042/ with username `orthanc`
and password `orthanc`. The nginx docker has also been set up to work as a reverse proxy
with orthanc to allow ongoing development via http://localhost:8090/orthanc/ (Note this reverse
proxy is still a work in progress)

##### FHIR
A FHIR server is included to make it easier to test on a bona fide FHIR server as developers
work towards supporting FHIR via OpenEMR's API. The FHIR server is docker from
https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server and see there for instructions of use.

#### The Insane Docker Development Environment is a work in progress

This is an ongoing work in progress and feel free to join the super exciting
OpenEMR container projects. Feel free to post PR's to update the
docker-compose.yml script or this documentation. Also feel free to post
updates on the openemr/openemr:flex or openemr/openemr:flex-edge dockers
which can be found at
https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/docker/openemr

#### Stuff that needs fixing
1. The reverse proxy for orthanc
