# Secondary Login Logo

This README ensures the directory path exists for branding the login page.

To add a secodnary logo on the login page, place an image file
in this folder named "logo". File type can be PNG, JPG, SVG, or any other
file type that can be rendered using the `<img>` tag's `src` property.

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.

This allows every multisite install to showcase a custom primary logo.

You must enable the Global setting found under "Login Page" titled
"Show Secondary Logo on Login Page" for this logo to be rendered.
