# Primary Login Logo

This README ensures the directory path exists for branding the login page.

To change the standard "OpenEMR" logo on the login page, place an image file
in this folder named "logo". File type can be PNG, JPG, SVG, or any other
file type that can be rendered using the `<img>` tag's `src` property.

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.

This allows every multisite install to showcase a custom primary logo.
