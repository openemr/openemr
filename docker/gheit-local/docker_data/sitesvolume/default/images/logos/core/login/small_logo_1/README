# Small Logo One

This README ensures the directory path exists for branding the login page.

To change the small logo on the login page, replace the file in this folder
named logo.png with your own. File type can be PNG, JPG, SVG, or any other
file type that can be rendered using the `<img>` tag's `src` property.

The initial file in this folder is a placeholder, allowing you to see what your
login pag will look like with a small logo.

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.

This allows every multisite install to showcase a custom small logo.

You must enable the Global setting found under "Login Page" titled
"Show Mini Logo 1" for this logo to be rendered.

Recommended dimensions of this logo is 300x100.
