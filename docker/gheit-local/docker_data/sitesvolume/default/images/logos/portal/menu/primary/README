# Primary Portal Menu Logo

This README ensures the directory path exists for branding the portal menu.

To change the standard "OpenEMR" logo on the portal menu, place an image file
in this folder named "logo". File type can be PNG, JPG, SVG, or any other
file type that can be rendered using the `<img>` tag's `src` property.

Only put **one** file in this folder, or you will encounter unexpected results.

This allows every multisite install to showcase a custom primary logo.
