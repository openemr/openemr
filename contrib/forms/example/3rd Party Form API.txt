 ******* Introduction *******

OpenEMR is more than a simple EMR suite, it is a modular platform that allows for customized modifications to meet specific needs.

To create a set of patient encounter forms for use with OpenEMR, at least a limited knowledge of the PHP scripting language and the MySQL syntax is needed. The script _must_ be stored in the interface/forms/your_script_name/ directory, with at least these four files:
	new.php		<-- will be acessed for new data entry
	view.php	<-- will be used to view your form
	print.php	<-- should be used to print your form
	SQL.php		<-- contains sql table creation scripts

 ******* Initialization *******

To initialize the 3rd party php library (from interface/forms/your_script_name/myfile.php):
	include_once("../../../library/api.inc");


 ******* Functions *******

--->>	formHeader("my form title name here")
	This is the suggested title header for forms. It maintains the style used by the rest of the suite for consistency.


--->>	formFooter()
	Our suggested footer.


--->>	formSubmit("my_table", $array_to_import, "0")
	Submit will submit your array into the database, in the table created during your script install process.  The array to import should be a single dimension such as the following:

		$myArray['column_name1']  = 'my column1 value';

The third argument to formSubmit() is a url to redirect to after the data from a form has been saved.  If you set this to "0" (its default) then it will forward back to $GLOBALS['form_exit_url']. This is the preferred operation, since users expect to be taken back to the Patient Encounter screen after saving a new form.


--->>	formFetch("my_table", 'record id', 'columns wanted', 'activity state')
	This function will retrieve one record of data.  The record id must be a numeric entry in the database.  The columns wanted defaults to "*", or all columns. If only a few columns are needed, setting columns wanted manually as follows: "id, activity, column-x" for example - usually id and activity are needed by the form, so it's a good idea to include those.  The activity state controls the visibility, or activity, of the records - you can view normal records with it set to "1" (its default) or view deleted records with "0" or both with "all".


--->>	formGetIds("my_table", 'wanted columns', 'limit', 'start point', 
'activity state')
	This function retrieves a set of ids ordered by date descending from the most recent.  "wanted columns" will once again have a default of "*".  Limit defaults to "all" with returns unlimited results.  Placing a number in its place with limit the results.  'start point' is a starting point or offset for the limited results, and 'activity state' acts as stated above.


--->>	formDisappear("my_table", 'record id')
	This effectively sets the activity state to 0, causing the records to be invisible during normal suite usage. This is equivalent to letting the user delete a record. However, for maximum legal compliance, all data entered into OpenEMR should be saved. Instead of deleting records then, we merely make them invisible to normal user interface operations.


--->>	formReappear("my_table", 'record id)
	This function will reverse the effects of formDisappear, cause the record to once again be active. Use this if you allow the user to modify the active or inactive flag.
