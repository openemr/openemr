1388	If you do not agree with the approved amounts and $100 or more is in dispute (less deductible and coinsurance), you may ask for a hearing within six months of the date of this notice. To meet the $100, you may combine amounts on other claims that have been denied, including reopened appeals if you received a revised decision. You must appeal each claim on time.
1389	If you do not agree with this determination, you have the right to appeal. You must file a written request for an appeal within 180 days of the date you receive this notice. Decisions made by a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) must be appealed to that QIO within 60 days.
1390	If you do not agree with what we approved for these services, you may appeal our decision. To make sure that we are fair to you, we require another individual that did not process your initial claim to conduct the appeal. However, in order to be eligible for an appeal, you must write to us within 120 days of the date you received this notice, unless you have a good reason for being late.
1391	If you have chosen to upload electronic remittances, then the search window redisplays itself with the matching invoices from the X12 file.  You may click on any of these invoice numbers (as described below) if you wish to make any corrections before the remittance information is applied. To apply the changes, click the Process ERA File button at the bottom of the page.  This will produce a new window with a detailed report.
1392	If you have entered a Pay Date in the search page, this will override the posting date of payments and adjustments that are otherwise taken from the X12 file.  This may be useful for reporting purposes, if you want your receipts reporting to use your posting date rather than the insurance company\'s processing date.  Note that this will also affect dates of prior payments and adjustments that are put into secondary claims.

3212	The initial window is the invoice search page.  At the top you may enter a source (e.g. check number), pay date and check amount.  The reason for the source and pay date is so that you don\'t have to enter them over and over again for each claim.  The amount that you enter will be decreased for each invoice that is given part of the payment, and hopefully will end at zero when you are done.
3213	The law permits exceptions to the refund requirement in two cases: - If you did not know, and could not have reasonably been expected to know, that we would not pay for this service; or - If you notified the patient in writing before providing the service that you believed that we were likely to deny the service, and the patient signed a statement agreeing to pay for the service. If you come within either exception, or if you believe the carrier was wrong in its determination that we do not pay for this service, you should request appeal of this determination within 30 days of the date of this notice. Your request for review should include any additional information necessary to support your position. If you request an appeal within 30 days of receiving this notice, you may delay refunding the amount to the patient until you receive the results of the review. If the review decision is favorable to you, you do not need to make any refund. If, however, the review is unfavorable, the law specifies that you must make the refund within 15 days of receiving the unfavorable review decision. The law also permits you to request an appeal at any time within 120 days of the date you receive this notice. However, an appeal request that is received more than 30 days after the date of this notice, does not permit you to delay making the refund. Regardless of when a review is requested, the patient will be notified that you have requested one, and will receive a copy of the determination. The patient has received a separate notice of this denial decision. The notice advises that he/she may be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid, if you should have known that we would not pay and did not tell him/her. It also instructs the patient to contact our office if he/she does not hear anything about a refund within 30 days

You may appeal this determination. You may ask for an appeal regarding both the coverage determination and the issue of whether you exercised due care. The appeal request must be filed within 120 days of the date you receive this notice. You must make the request through this office.
