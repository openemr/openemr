Alternatively, you may use the search page to upload an electronic remittance (X12 835) file that you have obtained from your payer or clearinghouse.  You can do this by clicking the Browse button and selecting the file to upload, and then clicking Search to perform the upload and display the corresponding invoices.  In this case the other parameters mentioned above do not apply and will be ignored.  Uploading saves the file but does not yet process its contents -- that is done separately as described below.

Depending on the type of bill you are testing you will see HCFA like output on a blank page for HCFA bills, you will see many lines of somewhat garbled text  and information if you are testing an X12 claim. That garbled text is the X12 EDI 4010A format. Occasionally you will see odd characters that look like dominoes or  squiglies, these are control characters such as page feeds and are normal.

If you have chosen to upload electronic remittances, then the search window redisplays itself with the matching invoices from the X12 file.  You may click on any of these invoice numbers (as described below) if you wish to make any corrections before the remittance information is applied. To apply the changes, click the Process ERA File button at the bottom of the page.  This will produce a new window with a detailed report.
If you have entered a Pay Date in the search page, this will override the posting date of payments and adjustments that are otherwise taken from the X12 file.  This may be useful for reporting purposes, if you want your receipts reporting to use your posting date rather than the insurance company\'s processing date.  Note that this will also affect dates of prior payments and adjustments that are put into secondary claims.

Pay
Pay attention to the "Done with" checkboxes.  After the insurances are marked complete then we will start asking the patient to pay the remaining balance; if you fail to mark all of the insurances complete then the remaining amount will not be collected!  Also if there is a balance that the patient should pay, then set the due date appropriately, as this will affect the language that appears on patient statements.

The initial window is the invoice search page.  At the top you may enter a source (e.g. check number), pay date and check amount.  The reason for the source and pay date is so that you don\'t have to enter them over and over again for each claim.  The amount that you enter will be decreased for each invoice that is given part of the payment, and hopefully will end at zero when you are done.

The remaining information below applies only if you are posting manually, or if you are doing manual corrections.
The Source and Date columns are copied from the first page, so normally you will not need to touch those.  You can put a payment amount in the Pay column, an adjustment amount in the Adjust column, or both.  You can also click the "W" on the right to automatically compute an adjustment value that writes off the remainder of the charge for that line item.

Upon clicking an invoice number the "manual posting window" appears. Here you can change the due date and notes for the invoice, select the party for whom you are posting, and select the insurances for which all expected paymants have been received.  Most importantly, for each billing code for which an amount was charged, you can enter payment and adjustment information.
Upon searching you are presented with a list of invoices.  You may click on one of the invoice numbers to open a second window, which is the data entry page for manual posting.  You may also click on a patient name if you want to enter a note that the front office staff will see when the patient checks in, and you may select invoices to appear on patient statements and print those statements.

It is obvious with HCFA claims because they are human readable, with X12 claims it is a more difficult process to determine if the claim is properly complete.

 Pecularities in many browsers may mean that the output below enters your screen in sudden jerks and that there are long pauses of several seconds where it  appears as though things may have crashed. That is not the case, you will eventually see output coming out line by line. There may be sequential numbers appearing  below, this is to indicate that even though nothing else may be displaying there is activity going on. These numbers will be interspersed with the content of the  billing and that is normal.
