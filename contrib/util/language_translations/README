This directory holds the developer tools to maintain the language translations.
These were created during development of OpenEMR version 3.0.2

The collectConstants.pl script can be used to collect all of the constants
from the openemr source code.  This script uses the manuallyAddedConstants.txt and 
manuallyRemovedConstants.txt list to manually add or remove constants from
the final output. Note that it also requires a list of old constants
(this can be over-rided) to ensure no old constants are lost (ie ensure
previous versions of openemr are still supported) Instructions are included in
the file.
  -The manuallyRemovedConstants.txt file includes constants to filter out.
   This is a good place to place any 'junk' constants that are erroneously
   found by collectConstants.pl script.
  -The manuallyAddedConstants.txt file includes constants to add manually to
   the list of constants. This should be only temporary as we implement
   a mechanism for developers to include these constants in the source 
   code where they are called.
  -The filterDirectories.txt file includes paths to ignore in the searching.

The buildLanguageDatabase.pl performs several functions.
  -Builds the foreign language SQL tables dumpfile for the lang_languages,
   lang_constants, and lang_definitions tables from the above
   current_spreadsheet.tsv file.
     -Outputs to logfile the database statistics.
  -Performs data validation on the spreadsheet structure, constants, and
   constant ID numbers.
     -Outputs to logfile errors.
       -The most recent logfile is kept in the log_buildLanguageDatabase.txt file
         which allows easy debugging (ie. which english constant was modified)
         via the diff command.
  -Builds a new spreadsheet that can be used for building an updated spreadsheet
   via the combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script.

The combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script will combine a the list of constants
with the language spreadsheet to create a new spreadsheet that can be uploaded
to Google Docs.

The sortCleanList.pl script is simply a script to remove blank lines, windows
end line, repeats, and sort the manuallyRemovedConstants.txt and 
manuallyAddedConstants.txt files.

The current official list of constants are kept in the currentConstants.txt file,
which are produced by the collectConstants.pl script.

The most current spreadsheet is kept in the current_spreadsheet.tsv file (this
file is taken after being processed with buildLanguageDatabase.pl script).

When adding constants or removing constants then run the collectConstants.pl
script to create the list of constants. Then run the
combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script to re-build an official language spreadsheet
to export to Google Docs.

The Google Docs spreadsheet after conversion to tsv format (and processed by
the buildLanguageDatabase.pl is kept in the
current_spreadsheet.tsv file. Conversion is done by exporting spreadsheet
from google docs (ods format). Then, open this file in OpenOffice. Then in
open office change the formatting of the first row and column to numbers
with no decimal places. Then, in Open Office 
select File->Save as. For 'Save as type:' select 'TEXT CSV (.csv)', toggle
on 'Edit Filter Setting', and change filename extension to .tsv. If asked
for confirmation select 'Yes'. Then select 'Unicode (UTF-8)' for 'Character
set', select {Tab} for 'Field delimiter', and select nothing (make blank by
removing the " character) for 'Text delimiter', and then click 'OK'.

The current_spreadsheet.tsv file is what can be uploaded to Google Docs for
collaboration.

The currentLanguage_utf8.sql and currentLanguage_latin1.sql holds current
sql tables dumpfile.
