I. Introduction

	The objective of this appliance is to simplify the process of
development in OpenEMR, and allows the developer to start with the most
recent CVS version of OpenEMR. Think of this as a portable and disposable
OpenEMR development environment.

	When starting the appliance for the first time, it will download,
install, and configure the CVS version of OpenEMR.  It will also place
a tarball and zip package of the CVS version to allow easy transfer to
other systems for testing etc.

	When shutting down the appliance, you have the option of
saving your changes or reverting back to the original state of appliance.


II. Instructions for use

	A. Start the appliance
		Start the appliance with VMware Player. If starting
	the appliance for the first time, it will download, install,
	and configure the CVS version of OpenEMR from
	Sourceforge. If it is not the first time, then it will just 
	startup. An intro screen will provide further instructions.

	B. Stop the appliance
		When shutting down the appliance, you have the option
	of saving your changes(select 'Just Power Off') or going
	back to the original state of appliance(select 'Revert to
	Snapshot'). Note that if you choose to 'Revert to Snapshot',
	your data will be lost!	

	C. Helpful tips
		-Note that the installed software is separate from
	the CVS directory. This is for a reason; active development
	should happen in the installed software directories, such as
	/var/www/html/openemr. The changes can then be copied to the
	CVS directory and then committed on sourceforge (this assumes
	you have OpenEMR sourceforge developer access).
		-The SSH port is open for a reason; works for
	copy/paste and less awkward than using the VMWare console.
		-Jed text editor works well.

	D. How this thing was built and how it works
		-For building instructions check out:
		   /home/openemr/docs/HowThisApplianceWasBuilt.txt
		-On startup the /etc/rc.d/init.d/StartupDeveloperAppliance
	script is run, which downloads CVS.  This script then calls a 
	script within OpenEMR openemr/contrib/util/installScripts/cvsDemoInstall
	which installs and configures OpenEMR.
