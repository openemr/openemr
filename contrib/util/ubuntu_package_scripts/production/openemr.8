We pursue grants to help fund the future development of OpenEMR.  To apply for these grants, we need to estimate how many times this program is installed and how many practices are evaluating or using this software.  It would be awesome if you would email us at info@oemr.org if you have installed this software. The more details about your plans with this software, the better, but even just sending us an email stating you just installed it is very helpful.
