## Gemini-Specific Behaviors

### Code Generation
- When generating code with Gemini, mark sections with:
```php
/*
 * BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE - Gemini
 * The following code section was generated by Gemini AI
 */
// AI-generated code here
/*
 * END AI-GENERATED CODE - Gemini
 */
```

- For single lines:
```php
$result = processData($input); // AI-generated line - Gemini
```

### Development Approach
- Leverage Gemini's reasoning capabilities for complex architectural decisions
- Use Gemini's multimodal capabilities for understanding diagrams and documentation
- Apply Gemini's code analysis strengths for refactoring and optimization tasks

### Google Cloud Integration
- If using Google Cloud services, prefer Google Cloud PHP SDK patterns
- Follow Google Cloud best practices for authentication and API usage
- Consider Google Cloud healthcare APIs when relevant to OpenEMR features
