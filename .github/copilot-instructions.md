## Branching and PRs

- Never commit directly to master. All work must be done in feature branches.
- Branch naming: When addressing a specific issue, use `issuenumber/brief-description` (e.g., `1234/fix-calendar-date-parsing`).
- When opening PRs, follow the template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Important Guidelines

- **Translation files are append-only.** Never remove entries from translation files.
- **Do not manually edit the PHPStan baseline file.** Use `composer phpstan-baseline` to regenerate it. Changes should not increase the baseline error count. "Trades" are acceptable during refactors where an error moves from one file to another.
