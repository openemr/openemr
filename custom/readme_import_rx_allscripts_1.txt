Allscripts Rx Batch Import

* This feature allows import of prescriptions written by one or more providers in an organization to be
loaded directly in the patient's prescriptions and medications. The excel file generated by Allscripts
is digested using phpExcel package.  The package does not implement any access-control beyond log-in.
If physicians in your organization need control over import of data for their patients, additional development
effort is required.

Manual steps:
- May be this is too obvious but in case you have not entered any prescriptions in Allscripts
  a. sign up for the ePrescribe service at http://www.nationalerx.com/redirect.htm
  b. Enter at least one prescription
- Install phpExcel package (http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/)
- Review the sql file and update the openemr database. Use phpAdmin interface in openemr?
- Using your allscripts login, go to Reports -> Provider Report (Detailed), select a valid time range and press 'Display Report'.
- On the report action strip, choose Excel as 'Select a format' and click on export link to download the Excel file.
- This code is currently tested for Excel 2003 format only.  So save the file as .xls.
- Use Reports -> Patients -> Rx Import to start the import process.
- Response to the upload action provides the list of prescription entries added from the file.
- A file may be loaded multiple times - duplicate prescriptions are indicated by '*' in the first character of the report.
- After reviewing the prescriptions added from the file, review the exception that need corrective action in
  openemr records or allscripts patient records or in case of duplicate names, manual data entry for the correct patient.

Implementation Considerations:
- If you have historical data in Allscripts (or other sources that can be mapped to Allscripts layout), load the information
  in manageable batches in chronological order.  This will set the medication start dates for the patient records to the oldest
  dates.  

Future actions:
- Hopefully, automated exchange will soon make this manual interface irrelevant.
- If allscripts changes the layout of the excel files, the process will break.  Till then, this thing saves lot of time.
