	<description>
		It can often be useful to know what rows are being displayed in a DataTable, but this is made a bit harder in a table with Scroller enabled since it will draw only a section of the table's data, and only a part of that data will actually be visible in the viewport. This method makes it possible to know what the _display_ indexes of the shows show are.

		It is important to note that these indexes are 0 based - i.e. the first row in the table is index 0. Also the indexes are in display order and do not directly map to the data index. Use the `:eq()` operator to select rows (`dt-api row()`) based on display order (see example below).

var table = $('#myTable').DataTable();

var data = table.row( ':eq('+displayIndexes.start+')', {order:'applied', search:'applied'} ).data();
