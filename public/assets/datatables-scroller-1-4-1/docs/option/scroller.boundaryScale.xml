		Scroller uses the boundary scaling factor to decide when to redraw the table - which it typically does before you reach the end of the currently loaded data set (in order to allow the data to look continuous to a user scrolling through the data). If given as 0 then the table will be redrawn whenever the viewport is scrolled, while 1 would not redraw the table until the currently loaded data has all been shown. You will want something in the middle - the default factor of 0.5 is usually suitable.
