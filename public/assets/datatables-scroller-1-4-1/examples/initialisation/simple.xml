<info><![CDATA[

Scroller is a plug-in for DataTables which enhances DataTables' built-in scrolling features to allow large amounts of data to be rendered on page very quickly. This is done by Scroller through the use of a virtual rendering technique that will render only the part of the table that is actually required for the current view.

Note that Scroller **requires** that all rows are of the same height (in order to preform its positional calculations). You can use the `nowrap` class of the [DataTables default stylesheet](https://datatables.net/manual/styling/classes#nowrap), or add `th, td { white-space: nowrap; }` to your CSS, to ensure that text in rows does not wrap.

This example shows how Scroller for DataTables can be initialised, when the Scroller Javascript file is included, by simply setting the `s-init scroller` option to `true`. This option can also be given as an object to specify initialisation options for Scroller.

Deferred rendering (`dt-init deferRender`) should be used when Scroller is enabled to gain the speed benefits offered by Scroller. The data source for this example is an Ajax file (`dt-init ajax`).
