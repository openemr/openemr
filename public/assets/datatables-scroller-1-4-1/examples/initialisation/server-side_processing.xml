<title lib="Scroller">Server-side processing (5,000,000 rows)</title>

<info><![CDATA[

DataTables' server-side processing mode is a feature that naturally fits in with Scroller perfectly. Server-side processing can be used to show large data sets, with the server being used to do the data processing, and Scroller optimising the display of the data in a scrolling viewport.

When using server-side processing, Scroller will wait a small amount of time to allow the scrolling to finish before requesting more data from the server (200mS by default). This prevents you from DoSing your own server!

This example shows Scroller using server-side processing mode and 5 million rows. **Important** This particular example uses `dt-init ajax` as a function to _fake_ the data to show Scroller's ability to show large data sets. It does not have a real database behind it! You would normally not use `dt-init ajax` as a function to generate data, but rather as a url for where to fetch the real data!

In this example we also enable the `s-init scroller.loadingIndicator` option of Scroller to show the end user what is happening when they scroll passed the currently loaded data.
