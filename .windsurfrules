## Windsurf-Specific Behaviors

### IDE Integration
- Leverage Windsurf's intelligent code completion and suggestion capabilities
- Use Windsurf's project-wide understanding for better context-aware suggestions
- Prefer Windsurf's multi-file editing capabilities for related changes across the codebase

### Code Generation
- When generating code with Windsurf, mark sections with:
```php
/*
 * BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE - Windsurf
 * The following code section was generated by Windsurf AI
 */
// AI-generated code here
/*
 * END AI-GENERATED CODE - Windsurf
 */
```

- For single lines:
```php
$result = processData($input); // AI-generated line - Windsurf
```

### File Creation Guidelines
- Use Windsurf's understanding of project structure for creating new OpenEMR components

- Prefer extending existing files over creating new ones
- Leverage Windsurf's template suggestions when available

### Development Workflow
- Use Windsurf's integrated terminal for running development commands
- Leverage Windsurf's built-in git integration for version control operations
- Use Windsurf's intelligent search and refactoring capabilities
- Take advantage of Windsurf's code analysis for identifying potential issues

### OpenEMR-Specific Optimizations
